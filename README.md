#  Bank-Tech-Test
A simple banking program that allows users to create an account, make deposits, make withdrawals and print an account statement. This project is the result of a tech test written in part fulfilment of the Makers Academy Coding Bootcamp.

This program is designed to meet the following requirements:
  * You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or the JavaScript console. (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
  * Deposits, withdrawal.
  * Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
  * Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

## Acceptance criteria
The following was the acceptance criteria:
  * Given a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012
  And a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012
  And a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012
  When she prints her bank statement
  Then she would see

  ```
  date || credit || debit || balance
  14/01/2012 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
  13/01/2012 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
  10/01/2012 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
  `````
